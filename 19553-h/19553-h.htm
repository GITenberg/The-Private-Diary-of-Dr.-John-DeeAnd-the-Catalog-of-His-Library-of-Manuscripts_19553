<p>The present volume contains two curious documents concerning Dr. Dee,
the eminent philosopher of Mortlake, now for the first time published
from the original manuscripts. I.&nbsp;His Private Diary, written in a
very small illegible hand on the margins of old Almanacs, discovered a
few years ago by Mr. W.&nbsp;H. Black, in the library of the Ashmolean
Museum at Oxford. II.&nbsp;A Catalogue of his Library of Manuscripts,
made by himself before his house was plundered by the populace, and now
preserved in the library of Trinity College, Cambridge.</p>

<p>The publication of this Diary will tend perhaps to set Dee’s
character in its true light, more than any thing that has yet been
printed. We have, indeed, his “Compendious Rehearsall,” which is in some
respects more comprehensive, but this was written for an especial
purpose, for the perusal of royal commissioners, and he has of course
carefully avoided every allusion which could be construed in an
unfavourable light. In the other, however, he tells us his dreams, talks
of mysterious noises in
<span class = "pagenum">viii</span>
his chamber, evil spirits, and alludes to various secrets of occult
philosophy in the spirit of a true believer. Mr. D’Israeli has given a
correct and able view of his character in his “Amenities of Literature,”
which is remarkably confirmed in almost every point by the narrative now
published. “The imagination of Dee,” observes that elegant writer,
“often predominated over his science; while both were mingling in his
intellectual habits, each seemed to him to confirm the other. Prone to
the mystical lore of what was termed the occult sciences, which in
reality are no sciences at all, since whatever remains occult ceases to
be science, Dee lost his better genius.” I shall refer the reader to
this popular work instead of attempting an original paper on the
subject, which would necessarily be greatly inferior to that drawn by
the masterly hand of the author of the “Curiosities of Literature.”</p>

<p>The Catalogue of Dee’s Library of Manuscripts, although long since
dispersed, is valuable for the notices which it preserves of several
middle-age treatises not now extant. He is said to have expended on this
collection the sum of three thousand pounds, a very large sum in those
days for a person of limited income.</p>

Nicols and Barthilmew Hickman cam. July 14th, Francys Nicols and
Barthilmew Hikman went homeward. July 17th, I willed the fellows to com
to me by nine the next day. July 18th, it is to be noted of the great
pacifications unexpected of man which happened this Friday; for in the
forenone (betwene nine and ten) where the fellows were greatly in doubt
of my heavy displeasure, by reason of their manifold misusing of
themselves against me, I did with all lenity interteyn them, and shewed
the most part of the things that I had browght to pass at London for the
college good, and told Mr. Carter (going away) that I must speak with
him alone. Robert Leigh and Charles Legh were by. Secondly, the great
sute betwene Redishmer and me was stayed and by Mr. Richard Holland his
wisdom. Thirdly, the organs uppon condition was admitted. And fourthly,

that Mr. Anthony considered him very liberally and frendely, but he told
him that he had promised me. Then he liked in him the fidelity of
regarding such his promise.</p>

<p>Oct. 13th, be it remembered that Sir Georg Both cam to Manchester to

It is almost unnecessary to observe that this and the following are
notes of nativities. They are not for the most part contemporary
notices, but apparently inserted at various times by Dee when
professionally consulted as an astrologer.</p>

“Anno 1555, Aug. 1, hora quarta a meridie Wigorniæ natus Dominus
Edouardus Kelæus,” MS. Ashm. 1788, fol. 140, where there is a horoscope
of this nativity in the handwriting of Dr. Dee. Ashmole, in his MS.
1790, fol. 58, says “Mr. Lilly told me that John Evans informed him that
he was acquainted with Kelly’s sister in Worcester, that she shewed him
some of the gold her brother had transmuted, and that Kelly was first an
apothecary in Worcester.”</p>

“Dr. Dee dwelt in a house neere the water side, a little westward from
the church [at Mortlake]. The buildings which Sir Fr. Crane erected for
working of tapestry hangings, and are still (1673) employed to that use,
were built upon the ground whereon Dr. Dee’s laboratory and other roomes
for that use stood. Upon the west is a square court, and the next is the
house wherein Dr. Dee dwelt, now inhabited by one Mr. Selbury, and
further west his garden.” &mdash;MS. Ashm. 1788, fol. 149. The same
account says that “Dr. Dee was wel beloved and respected of all persons
of quality thereabouts, who very often invited him to their houses or
came to his.”</p>

This of course is his celebrated Monas Hieroglyphica, frequently

1788, “dwelt then in Mortlack and was an intimate friend of Dr.
Dee’s.”</p>

This was his work printed in 1577 under the title of General and Rare
Memorials pertayning to the perfect Art of Navigation, in folio, now a
book of the greatest rarity. The original manuscript of it is in MS.
Ashm. 1789, and Dee’s own copy of the published work with MS. notes and
additions is preserved in the British Museum. In his Letter
Apologetical, 4to. Lond. 1603, he cites this work under the title of The
Brytish Monarchie, as having been written in the year 1576.</p>

Dee has occasionally made use of Greek letters for the preservation of
his notes, still retaining the English language. The present passage may
as well be given:&mdash; “This night my wife dreamed that one cam to her
and touched her, saying, ‘Mistres Dee, you are conceived of child, whose
name must be Zacharias; be of good chere, he sal do well as this
doth!’”</p>

<p class = "footnote">

His first wife died on the 16th of March 1575, when “the Queen’s
Majestie, with her most honourable Privy Council, and other her Lords
and Nobility, came purposely to have visited my library: but finding
that my wife was within four houres before buried out of the house, her
Majestie refused to come in; but willed to fetch my glass so famous, and
to show unto her some of the properties of it, which I did; her Majestie
being taken down from her horse by the Earle of Leicester, Master of the
Horse, at the church wall of Mortlake, did see some of the properties of
that glass, to her Majestie’s great contentment and delight.”
&mdash;<i>Compendious Memorial</i>, p. 516. This glass is spoken of
again.</p>

This probably gave rise to the anecdote which is related in MS. Ashm.
1788, fol. 147, viz. that “he revealed to one Roger Cooke the great
secret of the elixar, as he called it, of the salt of metalls, the
projection whereof was one upon an hundred.”</p>

Just above this relation some one has written, “you that rede this
underwritten assure yourselfe that yt is a shamfull lye, for Talbot
neither studied for any such thinge nor shewed himselfe dishonest in any
thinge.” Dr. Dee has thus commented upon it:&mdash; “This is Mr. Talbot
or that lerned man, his own writing in my boke, very unduely as he cam
by it.” There are several other notices of Talbot erased, but whether by
him or by the Doctor it is impossible to say, but most probably the
former.</p>

This work, although never entirely printed, created much sensation at
the time, and was the cause of considerable controversy among the
politicians as well as literati. The Memorial on this subject which Dee
presented to the Privy Council has been printed by Hearne and others,
but it is not generally known that the original manuscript of the actual
treatise on the correction of the Calendar is still preserved in
Ashmole’s library, No. 1789, and is the very book which Dee alludes to
above. It is inscribed “to the Right Honorable and my singular good
Lorde, the Lorde Burghley, Lorde Threasorer of Englande,” with the
following verses:&mdash;</p>

This refers to the earliest English translation of Euclid by
Billingsley, which was published in 1570, with a long preface by Dr.
Dee. Professor De Morgan is of opinion that the translation also was by
Dee, or that Billingsley may have been only a pupil who worked
immediately under his directions. The passage to which Dee alludes is as
follows:&mdash; “a man to be curstly affrayed of his owne shadow; yea,
so much to feare, that if you, being alone nere a certaine glasse, and
proffer, with dagger or sword, to foyne at the glasse, you shall
suddenly be moved to give backe (in maner) by reason of an image
appearing in the ayre betwene you and the glasse with like hand, sword,
or dagger, and with like quicknes, foyning at your very eye, likewise as
you do at the glasse. Straunge this is to heare of, but more mervailous
to behold then these my wordes cam signifie; and neverthelesse by
demonstration opticall the order and cause therof is certified; even so,
as the effect is consequent.” I refer the reader also to Mr. Barlow’s
History of Optics in the Encyclopedia Metropolitana.</p>

There are a great many brief notices in this diary relative to Jane Dee,
most of which are expressed in astrological symbols; and as they are
exceedingly difficult to decipher satisfactorily, and are certainly of
very little, if any importance, I have thought it expedient to omit
them. The entry of “<span class = "greek" title = "Vnar unq gurz">Ιανε

the history of optical science, and is similar to the curious treatise

report that the affairs of the Society continue in a condition of
unabated prosperity.</p>

maintained; and there continues to be a large number of Candidates for
admission upon vacancies.</p>

<p>The investment standing in the names of the Trustees for the Society
has been increased, since the last General Meeting, from the sum of £408
0<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i>, Three per Cent. consols, to £574 13<i>s.</i>
8<i>d.</i> This increase has arisen from the investment of sums received
for Compositions; and the Council recommend that whatever sum may now be
in hand on that account, should be added to the investment.</p>

<p>The Council have added the following gentlemen to the list of Local
Secretaries:&mdash;</p>

precedent of former years, in directing that there should be appended to
the last-mentioned volume a list of the Members of the Society for the
past year; and, if the General Meeting think proper, this Report and
that of the Auditors may also be added.</p>

<p>The Council have much satisfaction in being able to state that the
“Apology for the Lollards,” a work attributed to Wickliffe, which has
been so long delayed by reason of the many engagements of the Editor,
the Rev. Jas. Henthorn Todd, D.D. is now on the eve of completion; and
will certainly be ready for delivery in the ensuing year.</p>

<p>Considerable progress has also been made with the “Promptorium,” a
Latin and English Dictionary of words in use during the fifteenth
century, editing by Albert Way, Esq. F.S.A. a work which the Council
believe will be one of great merit and utility; and a portion of it will
be one of the publications of the ensuing year.</p>

<p>Besides the Apology for the Lollards and the Promptuary, the
following works have been ordered to be put to press at the convenience
of their Editors and the Society, and will be published as soon as they

<p>The Council have to direct the attention of the Society to the
obligations conferred upon it by J. I. Blackburne, Esq. M.P. by giving
the Society the use of the MS. of the Three Romances, edited by Mr.
Robson.</p>

<p>Also by the Right Hon. Thomas Grenville, in placing in Mr. Way’s
hands, upon the application of the Director, his valuable early printed
editions of the “Promptorium,” which Mr. Way wished to use for his
edition of that work; and by the Master and Fellows of Saint Peter’s
College, Cambridge, for the readiness with which, upon a similar
application, they lent the Council, for the use of Mr. Way, a valuable
MS., entitled Campus Florum.</p>

<p>The same exertions, in behalf of the Society, which former Councils
have acknowledged, have been continued to be made by the Local
Secretaries, and other friends of the Society resident in the country;
and the Council trust that such exertions will not be relaxed. To
diffuse a knowledge of
<span class = "pagenum camden">6</span>
the existence and objects of the Society tends, not merely to promote
its welfare, but also to carry out the purpose for which it was
established, by directing the attention of the possessors of MSS. to
those collections in which there yet exist, unpublished, inestimable
papers which this Society would be ready and willing to make
available.</p>

<p>Messrs. Nichols have continued to the Council the same attentions,
and have rendered them the same valuable and gratuitous assistance in
the general management of the affairs of the Society, which they have
given from its Institution. Nothing can be more honourable to Messrs.
Nichols, or more advantageous to the Society; and the Council are
assured, that it is only necessary for them to state the fact to the
Members, in order to its being duly appreciated.</p>

<p>The Council have to regret the loss, by death, during the last year,
of the Rt. Hon. <span class = "smallcaps">Thos. P. Courtenay</span>,
who, in addition to valuable services as a Member of the Council, was
one of the Trustees of the Society, and gave much attention to its
affairs. The Council have filled up the vacancy in the Trusteeship by

<p>The Council report that the Treasurer, having found that other
engagements prevented his any longer devoting to the accounts and
financial correspondence of the Society the time and attention which,
after an experience of three years, he found to be absolutely necessary
to be given to them, submitted to the Council the propriety of their
accepting his resignation, or of making some other arrangement with
respect to the accounts. The Council, regarding the subject as one
vitally affecting the welfare of the Society, proceeded immediately to
take it into their consideration, and are happy to be able to report
that they have effected an arrangement by which the accounts are now
kept, and the financial correspondence is attended to, by the Secretary,
the Treasurer still continuing responsible to the Society. This
arrangement will put the Society to a small annual expense, which can
very well be afforded, and which the Council are persuaded the Members
will think well bestowed, if it has the effect of preserving accuracy in
the accounts. The recent arrangements in the Post Office render it easy
for country Members to transmit their subscriptions by Post Office
orders, which course the Council recommend to be adopted, making the
Post Office orders payable to the Treasurer.</p>

<p>After the lapse of four years of continuing prosperity the Council
hope that the Camden Society may be regarded as having taken a permanent
station amongst established publishing associations. Many societies have
been founded upon similar principles, and one considerably out-numbers
this Society in Members: but there is no one which can produce better
evidences of stability and prosperity, or which has greater reason to be
satisfied with the estimation in which its works are regarded by the
public. Amongst the Candidates for admission recently entered there are
many Public Libraries and other bodies, whose desire to participate in
<span class = "pagenum camden">8</span>
the advantages of Membership indicates the reputation of the Society,
both in this and other countries; and the prices maintained by our books
when copies get abroad into the market, afford encouraging proof of the
demand for them on the part of collectors and literary men. In four
years the Society has issued eighteen volumes, all of them works
excluded from the ordinary mode of publication, and yet worthy of being
published, of eminent use to historical inquirers, and likely to retain
a place in the permanent literature of the country.</p>

<p>The forthcoming works are fully calculated to maintain, if not to
increase, the reputation of the Society, and the Council see no reason
to doubt but that the Society may long usefully and prosperously retain
its station, and the number of its Members.</p>

The Treasurer has also reported to us that the Secretary and himself
have made arrangements by which they hope, during the ensuing year,
almost, if not altogether, to get rid of all arrear of outstanding
subscriptions. We trust that the Members will assist them in this very
desirable object; and especially that Members resident in the country
will transmit their subscriptions at once to the Treasurer by Post
Office orders. The adoption of this course has been suggested by several
of the Local Secretaries; and it is obvious that it will greatly lessen
the troublesome and not very agreeable duties, which are thrown upon
those officers by the present practice, will lessen the number of
mistakes, and will greatly promote the prosperity of the Society.</p>

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
